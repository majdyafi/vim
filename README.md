# vim
vim settings

These are the three modules that I merely use to cutomise vim. The ~/.vimrc file sources these files. if you want to use these settings, simply clone this repository to ~/.vim/modules and add the following lines to yoru ~/.vimrc

```
filetype on
filetype plugin on

source  ~/.vim/modules/keymaps.vim
source  ~/.vim/modules/plugins.vim
source  ~/.vim/modules/settings.vim
```
